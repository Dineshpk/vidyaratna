# Vidyaratna

Vidyaratna (Jewel of Learning) is an initiative from the students on the FOSS club,  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. This 
project aims to provide a comprehensive curriculum for students to learn about computer science, development and 
open source. We help our students learn the skills (both technical and non technical) that would help them grow.
